Prompt 1,"Identify the central theme or metaphor from the graph representing a semantic analysis of a poem's text, divided into smaller ""communities"" or clusters of related words, with their dependencies and relationships illustrated through nodes and edges.
Integrate all key elements into a cohesive visual scene that represents the poem's essence. 
Ensure the generated prompt is coherent, detailed, and suitable for understanding of stable diffusion mode (image generation model)",2
Prompt 2,"Analyze the graph representing the semantic structure of a poem, divided into smaller 'communities' of words, their dependencies, and relationships. Identify the central theme or metaphor and integrate all key elements into a unified and visually descriptive prompt. Ensure the generated instruction is detailed, metaphorically rich, and optimized for input to a Stable Diffusion image generation model.",2.75
Prompt 3," Using the graph structure of a poem, with its communities of words and their dependencies, extract the poem's central theme and core metaphors. Translate these elements into a visually descriptive scene that conveys the poem's essence. The prompt should be imaginative, coherent, and formatted to be easily interpreted by a Stable Diffusion image generation model.",2.8
Prompt 4,"Examine the semantic graph of a poem, detailing word clusters and their dependency relationships. Derive the central metaphor or theme from the graph and create a vivid, cohesive instruction for generating an image. Ensure the prompt is rich in detail, metaphorically aligned with the poem, and suitable for Stable Diffusion to generate meaningful visuals.",3.5
Prompt 5,"From the graph representing a poem's semantic analysis, extract key metaphors and thematic elements. Develop a detailed image generation prompt that incorporates all important nodes and their relationships into a unified visual scene. The instruction should be imaginative, coherent, and specifically tailored for Stable Diffusion's understanding of metaphorical imagery.",4.25
Prompt 6,"Analyze the semantic graph of a poem to identify its core metaphors, emotions, and symbolic elements. Construct a rich and detailed image generation prompt that seamlessly integrates these key themes, ensuring that all significant nodes and their relationships contribute to a cohesive visual narrative. The prompt should be vivid, imaginative, and optimized for Stable Diffusionâ€™s ability to interpret and generate metaphorical and poetic imagery with cultural and contextual accuracy.",4
